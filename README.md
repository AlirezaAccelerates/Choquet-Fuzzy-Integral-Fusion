# Choquet Fuzzy Integral Fusion
This repository contains the implementation of a Choquet Fuzzy Integral Fusion Model. The Choquet Integral is a powerful aggregation operator used in multi-criteria decision making and image processing.

### Overview
The Choquet Fuzzy Integral Fusion Model is designed to combine multiple input features in a way that captures the interactions between them. This model can be particularly useful in scenarios where the importance of each feature and the synergy between them are not constant but vary depending on the context.

### Installation
To use this code, you need to have Python installed along with the necessary packages. You can install the required packages using the following command:
pip install numpy cvxopt
